The data contained in the trendr R package was analyzed exactly like detailed in this document. randomData is a time series of increasing random numbers with a peak.

The main function `trendr` also for both mu (trend) and beta (first derivative) to be calculated from a dataframe. However, sometimes the user may want to calculate either from a series of values. This is what `trendr_mu` and `trendr_beta` can be used for.


```{r}
library(knitr)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(collapse = T, comment = "#>")

library(trendr)
library(readr)
library(dplyr)

head(randomData)
```

For mu.

```{r}
trendr::trendr_mu(randomData$value)
```

For beta.

```{r}
trendr::trendr_beta(randomData$value)
```
