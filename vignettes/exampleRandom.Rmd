The data contained in the trendr R package was analyzed exactly like detailed in this document. randomData is a time series of increasing random numbers with a peak.

First, because the data is contained in a package, we can easily call it from R


```{r}
library(trendr)
head(randomData)
```

Run trendr on the data and produce a simple plot.

```{r}
trendr(df = randomData,
        value.colname = 'value',
        time.colname = 'date',
        output.dir = '', 
        output.file = 'randomData.csv',
        output.plot = T)
```
